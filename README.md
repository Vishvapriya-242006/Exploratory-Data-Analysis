#  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project performs a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset to understand its structure, patterns, and relationships among features. The goal is to use visual and statistical techniques to generate insights and prepare the data for further modeling or reporting.

---

###  Objectives

- Generate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)
- Create histograms and boxplots for numerical features
- Use pairplots and correlation matrices to explore feature relationships
- Identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data
- Draw basic inferences at the feature level using visualizations

---

###  Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – for data handling
- **NumPy** – for numerical computations
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – for data visualization

---

###  Key Visuals

- **Histograms**: Analyze the distribution of each numeric variable
- **Boxplots**: Detect outliers and visualize data spread
- **Pairplot**: Explore pairwise relationships
- **Correlation Matrix**: Identify correlated features

---

###  Insights and Observations

- Central tendencies and spread of numeric features
- Skewness or irregularities in distributions
- Outliers and missing values
- Feature correlations and potential multicollinearity
- Notable patterns or trends

### How to Use

1. Load the dataset into a DataFrame
2. Run each section (summary, visuals, etc.)
3. Review plots and note down insights
4. Use visuals and findings to guide data cleaning or modeling steps
